# IoT Toll Systtem Supervisor
There are thousands of vehicles on road these days and managing these multiple vehicles at a toll booth at the same time is a very difficult job to be done. At present, the manual toll system is very inefficient and very time-consuming. Due to this, there are traffic jams, fights, exchanges of words also. The system proposed is completely managed on the ‘Internet of Things’ concept based on RFID technology. The Internet server will store all the users ' required data and their card balance. When the car driver will arrive at the toll booth, the system at the toll booth will scan the card. The system then connects to the online server to check the validation of the card, if the card is valid and will be having sufficient funds then the particular amount will get deduced from the card. The system operates a motor to open the toll gate for a car to pass on deduction of the card balance. The entire system uses a microcontroller to achieve this purpose. The WiFi connection connects to the internet through which the system interacts for online verification. Additionally, all the data of the vehicles passed will get stored for later reference. Thus, the system automates the entire process of the toll booth and terminates the present process of the toll booth collection system.
