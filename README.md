# IoT Toll Systtem Supervisor
## Introduction
There are thousands of vehicles on the road these days and managing these multiple vehicles at a toll booth simultaneously is a very difficult job to do. At present, the manual toll system is very inefficient and very time-consuming. Due to this, there are traffic jams, fights, and exchanges of words. The system proposed is completely managed on the ‘Internet of Things’ concept based on RFID technology. The Internet server will store all the users ' required data and their card balances. When the car driver arrives at the toll booth, the system at the toll booth will scan the card. The system then connects to the online server to check the validation of the card, if the card is valid and has sufficient funds then the particular amount will be deducted from the card. The system operates a motor to open the toll gate for a car to pass on the deduction of the card balance. The entire system uses a microcontroller to achieve this purpose. The WiFi connects to the internet through which the system interacts for online verification. Additionally, all the vehicle data passed will be stored for later reference. Thus, the system automates the entire process of the toll booth and terminates the present process of the toll booth collection system.
